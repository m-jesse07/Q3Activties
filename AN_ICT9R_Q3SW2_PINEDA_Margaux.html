			<td><div class="col-9 text-justify">Sixteen-year-old Poppy (Emma Roberts) has everything her unlimited credit cards can buy, and a spoiled attitude to match. After a final thoughtless prank, her exasperated father (Aidan Quinn) ships her off to boarding school in England. There, Poppy meets her match in a stern headmistress (Natasha Richardson) and a class full of girls who will not tolerate her selfishness. The main message from this movie is that no-one should give up on themselves or others. Even the most obnoxious person can change. Values in this movie that you might wish to discuss with your children include honesty, loyalty and courage.

			<td><div class="col-9 text-justify">Shallow, rich and socially successful Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is at the top of her Beverly Hills high school's pecking scale. Seeing herself as a matchmaker, Cher first coaxes two teachers into dating each other. Emboldened by her success, she decides to give hopelessly klutzy new student Tai (Brittany Murphy) a makeover. When Tai becomes more popular than she is, Cher realizes that her disapproving ex-stepbrother (Paul Rudd) was right about how misguided she was -- and falls for him. The plot centers on a beautiful, popular, and rich high school student who befriends a new student and decides to give her a makeover while playing a matchmaker for her teachers and examining her own existence. Clueless was filmed in California over a 40-day schedule.</td>

			<td><div class="col-9 text-justify">Teenage Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) was educated in Africa by her scientist parents. When her family moves to the suburbs of Illinois, Cady finally gets to experience public school and gets a quick primer on the cruel, tacit laws of popularity that divide her fellow students into tightly knit cliques. She unwittingly finds herself in the good graces of an elite group of cool students dubbed "the Plastics," but Cady soon realizes how her shallow group of new friends earned this nickname. The plot centers on a na√Øve teenage girl navigating her way through the social hierarchy of a modern American high school after years of her parents homeschooling her while conducting research in Africa. Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels produced the film.</td>
