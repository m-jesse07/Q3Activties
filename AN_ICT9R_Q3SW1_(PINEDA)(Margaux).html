				<p>Emily in Paris is an American romantic comedy drama television series created by Darren Star for Netflix. Set in Paris, the series stars Lily Collins as aspiring marketing executive Emily Cooper, an American who moves to France to provide an American point of view to a French marketing firm. There, she struggles to succeed in the workplace while searching for love and experiencing a culture clash with her conventional Midwestern U.S. upbringing. It also stars Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Ashley Park, Lucas Bravo, Samuel Arnold, Bruno Gouery, Camille Razat, William Abadie, and Lucien Laviscount. Produced by MTV Entertainment Studios and originally developed for Paramount Network, where it was given a straight-to-series order in September 2018, the series moved to Netflix in July 2020. Filming takes place in ÃŽle-de-France, mainly in Paris and its suburbs, and began in August 2019. Emily in Paris premiered on October 2, 2020, to positive reviews in the United States but was criticized in France, with many French critics condemning the show for negatively stereotyping Parisians and the French. In November 2020, the series was renewed for a second season by Netflix, which premiered on December 22, 2021. In January 2022, the series was renewed for a third and fourth season by Netflix. The third season premiered on December 21, 2022. The show brought the modern, sexual, relatable, though not always likeable female hero to the fore and changed television forever. His most recent show, Emily in Paris, continues this tradition, and with its third season on the way and its fourth already confirmed, Starr has been given a great opportunity to reshape, expand, and surprise these characters.</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">ðŸ’‹ (EMILY COOPER)</h3>
				<p>"Emily Cooper, played by Lily Collins, is a warm, friendly, and somewhat careless protagonist of the show. With a Masterâ€™s degree in marketing, she swiftly takes advantage of the opportunity to move to Paris for an unexpected job opportunity at the marketing firm, Savoir. Tasked with bringing an American point of view to a French marketing firm, she often butts heads with her proud French boss, Sylvie. This is not aided by the fact that she does not bother to adjust to the culture by learning the language. However, soon her enthusiasm and resilience lead her to gain the respect of the others. Her love life has not been so straightforward unfortunately. After breaking up with her Chicago boyfriend, Doug, she begins a flirtation with her downstairs neighbor, Gabriel, a chef who happens to be the boyfriend of her friend Camille. At the end of Season 1, the two hook up, and though she tries to hide it, Camille finds out. Season 2 ends with Emily and Camille rekindling their friendship after she promises not to date Gabriel. Emily then begins seeing a British man named Alfie and Gabriel gets back together with Camille, but itâ€™s clear the two have unfinished business."</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">(CAMILLE) ðŸ‘›</h3>
				<p>"Camille Razat plays Camille, Emilyâ€™s first French friend in Paris. Their friendship is complicated by Emilyâ€™s attraction to Camilleâ€™s boyfriend Gabriel. When Camille discovers Emily and Gabrielâ€™s tryst, she delivers a scathing toast at Emilyâ€™s birthday dinner and abruptly ends their friendship. She ices Emily out of her personal life as well as her professional life by asking Savoir to remove Emily from managing her family businessâ€™ account. After some time passes, Camille forgives Emily after she promises not to date Gabriel. Season 2 ends with Camille moving in to Gabrielâ€™s apartment. Camille Razat first rose to prominence for her role in the French police thriller, The Disappearance, but has since worked with directors like Clint Eastwood in The 15:17 to Paris and actresses like Isabelle Adjani in Diane de Poitiers."</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">ðŸ§³ (ALFIE)</h3>
				<p>"Lucien Laviscount plays Alfie, a 30-year-old British banker that Emily meets in her French class in Season 2. Like her, he refuses to fully adapt or immerse himself in the culture. Emily initially does not like him but when they are assigned a class project together, their relationship begins to heat up. Alfie even strikes up a friendship with Gabriel, though he does not know about the history between the two. When he begins to grow suspicious, both of them deny their feelings. Alfie trusts her so much that he proposes that he and Emily commit to each other, even though he has to leave for London. Lucien Laviscount enjoyed several guest appearances in American TV shows for years but got his big break as Earl Grey in the first season of Scream Queens. Since then, he has appeared in the television adaptation of Snatch as well as on Katy Keene."</p>

				<h3 class="text-left">(SYLVIE) ðŸ’„</h3>
				<p>"Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu plays Sylvie, Emilyâ€™s hard-working and hard to please boss. She is intelligent and expects a lot from her employees. Because of her blunt honesty, she can often come across as harsh. However, in her private life, she leads a much more care free life as she enjoys an open relationship with her husband. She doesnâ€™t get along with Emily at the start because she finds this American arrival to be extremely intrusive. Her attitude toward Emily shifts when Emily repairs the professional relationship between Sylvie and her lover Antoine Lambert in the first season. Season two ends with an infuriated Sylvie leaving the marketing firm after an unpleasant visit from Emilyâ€™s American boss. She announces she is launching her own luxury marketing firm and wants to take the whole team with her, including Emily, should she accept. Philippine Leroy Beaulieu has been a legend on the French screen for years and even made her debut in Surprise Party by Roger Vadim."</p>

				<h3 class="text-right">ðŸŒ¼ (MINDY CHEN)</h3>
				<p>"Ashley Park plays Mindy Chen, a Chinese Korean former nanny and aspiring singer who becomes Emilyâ€™s first friend in Paris. Though she is the daughter of a Singapore business magnate, she wants to make it on her own, much to her fatherâ€™s dismay. She helps Emily adjust to the new culture while Emily helps her gain confidence in her singing after a traumatic experience on a Chinese singing competition. Emily convinces her to pursue her singing career more seriously at the cost of her nannying job and Season 2 sees Mindy working at a cabaret. She meets two aspiring musicians/buskers and becomes their lead singer. She begins a romance with the guitarist Benoit, but things get complicated when he finds out about her past as an heiress. Thankfully, with Emilyâ€™s support, Mindy is able to smooth things over with the band and Benoit. Ashley Park first became known to audiences for her role as Gretchen Wieners in the original production of Mean Girls. She currently has a recurring role in Girls5eva and will appear alongside Steven Yeun in the series, Beef."</p>
